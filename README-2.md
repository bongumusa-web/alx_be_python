1. Simple Interest Calculator
mandatory
Objective: Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

Task Description:

Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

( I ) is the interest earned,
( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.
Instructions:

Create a file named simple_interest.py.
Define three variables in this file:
principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].
Expected Output:

When executed, your script should print the simple interest calculated with the provided values. For principal = 1000, rate = 0.05, and time = 3, the output should be:

The simple interest is: 150.0

2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
mandatory
Objective: Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

Task Description:

For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Instructions:

Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
Define two variables in this file:
length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].
Expected Output:

When executed, your script, with the provided values (length = 10 and width = 5), should print the area of the rectangle:

The area of the rectangle is: 50
